# TutorBest
<p> ## 💪🏼 Motivation </p>
There are many students in Universities who wish to teach part-time for various reasons, but they face multiple problems:

Difficulty in obtaining tutees, despite having the capability to teach. Full-time tutors like graduates, ex-MOE employees dominate the existing tuition platforms leaving little tutees left for out student tutors.

Inefficient means of communication between tutor and tutee in current platforms.
<p> ## 🎯 Aim </p>
We aim to connect tutors to potential tutees via our web application, making the process of finding tutees or tutors faster and more convenient.
